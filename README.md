## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/)

### What I learned

This project was a great opportunity to practice `tailwindcss` and apply it to build a grid. 

To build and watch the changes made with tailwind, I added this script on the `package.json`. 
```js
"scripts": {
  "tailwind": "npx tailwindcss -i ./styles/main.css -o ./main.css --watch"
}
```

### Useful resources

- [Tailwindcss docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) - The official documentation of tailwindcss. This was a great guide to install and know how to use the utility classes.
